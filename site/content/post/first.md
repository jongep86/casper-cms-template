We live in an age when stress seems to be around every corner, at every office.  The demands of modern life require us to be constantly “plugged in” through the internet, cell phones, and gaming devices.  You might feel as if your senses are constantly being bombarded, both at work and at home.  As a result, stress might have led you to the breaking point.\
\
But there is a great universal stress reliever—one that is close to everyone.  Nature offers bountiful opportunities for relieving stress.  It might seem old-fashioned to “commune with nature,” but it can be incredibly cathartic, decreasing your stress level immeasurably.\
\
First, you must be willing to take the time to drink in nature and all its beauty.  Often, we feel overwhelmed by commitments—so overwhelmed, in fact, that we become guilty if we take time out for ourselves.  However, if we are to successfully combat stress, we absolutely must reserve time for stress-relief, and nature can be one of the best stress relievers available.\
\
Each season offers its own unique brand of stress relief.  In the autumn, we can be soothed by the multi-colored leaves on the trees, the crunch of leaves under our feet, and lovely October skies.  By experiencing the beauty of nature, we can become more relaxed and better able to take on life’s challenges.\
\
In the winter, we can take brisk walks through the snow, watching the flakes delicately float down to earth.  We can be energized by the brisk winds and frigid temperatures.  We can also gain a certain amount of confidence in battling the elements, helping to relieve our stress level.\
\
In spring, we can enjoy the true riches of nature.  We can experience the scent of flowers just beginning to bloom…the loveliness of plants that have survived winter’s scourge…and listen to the birds chirping in the trees.  Gazing at trees just beginning to bud can be incredibly soothing after a stressful day on the job.\
\
Meanwhile, in the summer, we can experience nature at its most vibrant.  We can enjoy the scent of the grass after the lawn has just been mowed…and watch the trees gently waving in the summer breeze.  We can revel in the sun’s rays, or enjoy the refreshment of a summer shower.  Just a few minutes in the outdoors can reduce our stress level dramatically.\
\
There are also a number of nature-related activities we can engage in in order to relax.  For instance, hiking offers a tremendous opportunity to see the splendor of nature up close and personal.  Skiing allows us to enjoy winter’s beauty, while a game of Frisbee can be a tremendous lift on a summer afternoon.  Because nature offers such a feast for the senses, enjoying the outdoors can bring a sense of calm and tranquility to our lives that few other things can.\

Some people, like myself, have found a relaxing nature-related hobby in gardening.  Planting flowers or vegetables, trimming bushes, and weeding can help to relax both the mind and the body.  Others have found that yard work can help to reduce stress.  Such activities as mowing the lawn, raking leaves, or shoveling snow can help to remove us from sources of stress, giving us a much-needed break.\
\
You may be so inspired by nature that you write poetry about the things you see and hear.  Such writing can be tremendously cathartic, especially when undertaken outdoors.  Lying in a chaise lounge under a tree, composing sonnets about flowers, can get your creative juices flowing—and lower your stress level in the process.\
\
You might be surprised how therapeutic nature can be.  It can re-awaken your senses, allowing you to see things you might have missed before.  It can demonstrate to you the beauty of creation and give you a renewed vitality for life.  It can provide you with a welcome sanctuary from the world of blaring stereos and non-stop TV chatter.  Even if you don’t consider yourself a nature lover, brief periods outdoors can give you a new sense of purpose.  With such a positive outlook, your ability to handle stress will be enhanced.  In essence, spending a few moments outdoors is like taking a mini-vacation from the rigors of your daily life.
